Below is an example of how you could structure a README file for your PowerShell script, `MergeFilesAndCopy.ps1`. This README will provide users with all the information they need to use the script effectively.

# MergeFilesAndCopy PowerShell Script

## Description

`MergeFilesAndCopy.ps1` is a PowerShell script designed to concatenate the contents of files with specified extensions from the current directory and all its subdirectories, prefixing each file's content with its relative file path. The combined contents are then copied to the clipboard for easy pasting.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.0 or higher.
- Windows operating system.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply download the `MergeFilesAndCopy.ps1` file to your preferred directory.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. By default, the script processes files with the extensions `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, and `.jsx`. You can modify this by passing different extensions when running the script.

## Usage

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `MergeFilesAndCopy.ps1` script.
3. To run the script, enter the following command:

   ```powershell
   .\MergeFilesAndCopy.ps1 -Extensions "*.ext1", "*.ext2", "*.ext3"
   ```
   
   Replace `*.ext1`, `*.ext2`, `*.ext3` with the file extensions you want to process. For example, if you want to process `.html` and `.css` files, use:

   ```powershell
   .\MergeFilesAndCopy.ps1 -Extensions "*.html", "*.css"
   ```

   If you don't specify any extensions, the script will default to `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, and `.jsx`.

4. After the script has finished running, the combined content of the files will be copied to your clipboard. You can paste it wherever needed.

## Security Notice

Before running the script, you might need to alter your PowerShell execution policy, as PowerShell scripts are disabled by default for security reasons. To change the execution policy, open PowerShell as an Administrator and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This change allows the execution of PowerShell scripts that are created on your local machine. Be sure to understand the security implications of this change before proceeding.

## Troubleshooting

- **Script does not run**: Make sure you've set the execution policy to allow script execution. See the Security Notice section for more details.
- **Clipboard does not contain the expected content**: Verify that there are files matching your specified extensions within the directory or its subdirectories. If the files are too large, you might encounter issues with clipboard limitations.

For further assistance, please refer to the official PowerShell documentation or submit an issue on the repository where you downloaded this script.
